#### Why ReactJS? What are the Benefits and Reasons to choose it?
 - So, what are the top benefits ReactJs development company can get from using React in their projects and top reasons to choose?
 
* Component Style Architecture 
  - ReactJS is Component Style Architecture, and that is where the future of the web is.
    This Architecture has also helped the Java developer community to migrate to ReactJS with less friction.
* Less development time and higher quality 
  - React allows you to write clean and modular code, breaking the project into separate components.
    So we can reuse code, and which will increase the productivity of developers and ReactJS development company.
* High performance of your app 
  -  ReactJS main feature i.e Virtual DOM (in which representation of UI components is kept in memory and then synced with real DOM by library such as ReactDOM)
  that results in high performance of the app and gives better user experience
* Strong community 
  -  Being created by Facebook, the library is still maintained by the company as well as by independent contributors worldwide.
  Thanks to the community and solid corporate support, React is a reliable and up-to-date technology. Since the community is growing rapidly, it will be easier to hire reactjs developers.
* Flexible and easy to maintain
  - React code is easy to update and maintain due to its modular structure.
  React projects are incredibly flexible and can be scaled easily. It can help you to save time and money in the long run significantly.
* Many third-party components
  - Since React has a strong developer community, there are many third-party open source components available which we can use in our project.
* Easy transition to React Native
  - React Native is a mobile application development framework, based on React.
    Thus, it is effortless for ReactJS developers to switch to React Native and create mobile applications with a native look and feel.
    We can reuse some components developed in React web application in a React Native mobile app (mostly business logic), which improves the development speed.
* Itâ€™s easy to learn
  - React is much easier to learn than to other popular frontend frameworks like Angular & Vue.
    It's one of the main reasons why React gained so much popularity in little time. It helps businesses quickly build their projects.
* Create-react-app
  - React provides create-react-app, which do all initial heavy lifting of setting up configuration and helps us to focus on code and not toolchain.
  This command in React installs the dependencies needed to build your project and also generated an initial project structure.
  By running this command, we can quickly start with new projects.
* It helps to build rich user interfaces
  -  Today, the quality of the user interface in an application plays an important role.
  Poorly designed user interfaces lower the chances of an application to succeed. But, if an application has high-quality UI, then there are better chances for users to love to use the app. React permits building such high-quality, rich user interfaces through its components
* It allows writing custom components
  -   React comes with JSX, a syntax extension, which makes it possible to write your components.
  These components accept HTML quoting and also makes all subcomponent rendering a delightful experience for developers.
