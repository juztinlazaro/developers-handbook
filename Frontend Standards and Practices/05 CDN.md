# CDN

- A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver pages and other Web content to a use.
- All assets must be on cdn, so the server will only load or handle the script or business logic functions, scripts and css design

### Assets / files need to be load from CDN:

1. All type of images
2. Fonts
3. Documents `eg. docx, xlx, pdf and etc`
4. external assets,
   - Example you are using bootstrap css framework instead of import it locally, import it on cdn.
   - Example you are using google fonts, instead of import it locally, import it cdn.

`WIP for pros and cons`

### Pros

1.  It will optimize the server bundle / data
