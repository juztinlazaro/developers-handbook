# RESTFUL API
RESTful APIs enable you to develop any kind of web application having all possible CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations. REST guidelines suggest using a specific HTTP method on a specific type of call made to the server (though technically it is possible to violate this guideline, yet it is highly discouraged).

## [Get]
Use GET requests to retrieve resource representation/information only – and not to modify it in any way. As GET requests do not change the state of the resource, these are said to be safe methods. Additionally, GET APIs should be idempotent, which means that making multiple identical requests must produce the same result every time until another API (POST or PUT) has changed the state of the resource on the server.

### Example request URIs
        > HTTP GET http://www.example.com/users
        > HTTP GET http://www.example.com/users?size=20&page=5
        > HTTP GET http://www.example.com/users/123

## [Post]
Use POST APIs to create new subordinate resources, e.g. a file is subordinate to a directory containing it or a row is subordinate to a database table. Talking strictly in terms of REST, POST methods are used to create a new resource into the collection of resources.

### Example request URIs
        > HTTP POST http://www.example.com/users
             > Payload { “op”: “replace”, “path”: “/email”, “value”: “new.email@example.org” }
        > HTTP POST http://www.example.com/users/123/accounts

## [Patch]
HTTP PATCH requests are to make partial update on a resource. If you see PUT requests also modify a resource entity so to make more clear – PATCH method is the correct choice for partially updating an existing resource and PUT should only be used if you’re replacing a resource in its entirety.

### Example request URIs
        > HTTP PATCH http://www.example.com/users
            > Payload { “op”: “replace”, “path”: “/email”, “value”: “new.email@example.org” }


## [Put]
Use PUT APIs primarily to update existing resource (if the resource does not exist then API may decide to create a new resource or not). If a new resource has been created by the PUT API, the origin server MUST inform the user agent via the HTTP response code 201 (Created) response and if an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request.

    "The difference between the POST and PUT APIs can be observed in request URIs. POST requests are made on resource collections whereas PUT requests are made on an individual resource."

### Example request URIs
    > HTTP PUT http://www.example.com/users/123
    > HTTP PUT http://www.example.com/users/123/accounts/456

## [DELETE]
As the name applies, DELETE APIs are used to delete resources (identified by the Request-URI).

A successful response of DELETE requests SHOULD be HTTP response code 200 (OK) if the response includes an entity describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action has been queued, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been performed but the response does not include an entity.

### Example request URIs
    > HTTP DELETE http://www.example.com/users/123
    > HTTP DELETE http://www.example.com/users/123/accounts/456
    
## Safe Methods
As per HTTP specification, the GET and HEAD methods should be used only for retrieval of resource representations – and they do not update/delete the resource on the server. Both methods are said to be considered “safe“.

This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested – and they can update/delete the resource on server and so should be used carefully.

## Idempotent Methods
The term idempotent is used more comprehensively to describe an operation that will produce the same results if executed once or multiple times. This is a very useful property in many situations, as it means that an operation can be repeated or retried as often as necessary without causing unintended effects. With non-idempotent operations, the algorithm may have to keep track of whether the operation was already performed or not.

In HTTP specification, The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE are declared idempotent methods. Other methods OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD NOT have side effects so both are also inherently idempotent.


## Summary of Restful APIs Standards

| **HTTP METHODS** | **CRUD** | **ENTIRE COLLECTION (E.G./USERS)** | SPECIFIC ITEM (E.G. /USERS/123) |
---|---|---|---|
|POST | Create | 201 (Created), ‘Location’ header with link to /users/{id} containing new ID. | Avoid using POST on single resource|
| GET | Read | 200 (OK), list of users. Use pagination, sorting and filtering to navigate big lists. | 200 (OK), single user. 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid. |
| PUT | Update/Replace | 404 (Not Found), unless you want to update every resource in the entire collection of resource. | 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). Use 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid. |
| PATCH |  	Partial Update/Modify | 404 (Not Found), unless you want to modify the collection itself. | 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). Use 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid. |
| DELETE | Delete | 404 (Not Found), unless you want to delete the whole collection — use with caution. | 200 (OK). 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid. |
